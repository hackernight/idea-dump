=========

Collaboratory list of ideas, in no particular order.

---

## Agile Estimation
* Grid view of possible estimates
* Tap one to go to a big, white letter on black bg
* I need T-Shirt sizes but I'm open to whatever.
* Minimal on the animations, etc. The idea is to be good to the battery for longer sessions.
 
## Gmail canned responses
Gmail has an API https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/

* Leverage that to get a list of things in inbox, or things in a label
* User-defined list of canned responses
* Tap on thing, get list of responses and quick snippet/read of email
* tap on response to send it.

## Medicine tracker
* android app
* Give it an alias + situation
* something like "I took advil at 3pm, when can I take it again?"
* also "I need to take this every night at time X, remind me please"
* Automated reminders
* would also be interesting to do as a web app storing data in cache/cookie what not

## Voip server summary
* Click -> load mumble from shortcut
* Live tile -> scrolls through mumble servers with info
* Android widget
* Set up server+protocol list
